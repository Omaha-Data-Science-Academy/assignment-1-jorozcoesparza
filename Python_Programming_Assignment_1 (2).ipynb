        "- Limited user input validation and error checking is encouraged on this assignment. Each question below will indicate the type of input that you can expect. (for example, if the question states the input will be an integer you can expect the user to input an integer and do not need to check to ensure it is an integer versus a float or a string)\n",

        "- The examples given are samples of how we will test/grade your code. Please ensure your scripts output the same information.\n",
        "- If you are stuck on a problem or do not understand a question - please come to office hours or ask questions to the class slack group (please don't post your code though). If it is a coding problem send a private message to your instructor.\n",
        "- Hints are given in some of the questions; these are optional so you do NOT need to use the hint (or code your answer that way) as long as your code meets the requirements of the problem.\n",
